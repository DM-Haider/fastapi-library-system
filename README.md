# FastAPI Library System

A simple library management system built with **FastAPI**.
All data is stored in memory (a Python list inside the code) — no database is used.

## Features

- List all books (with optional search)
- Get a single book by id
- Add a new book
- Partially update a book
- Delete a book

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Success Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/books` | List all books (add `?query=...` to search by title/author/publisher) | 200 |
| GET | `/books/{id}` | Get a single book | 200 |
| POST | `/books` | Add a new book | 201 |
| PATCH | `/books/{id}` | Update some fields of a book | 200 |
| DELETE | `/books/{id}` | Delete a book | 204 |

**Error responses:**

- `400 Bad Request` — required fields are missing on POST (`title`, `author`, `publisher`)
- `404 Not Found` — no book exists with the given id

**Book object:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Clean Code",
  "author": "Robert C. Martin",
  "publisher": "Prentice Hall"
}
```
